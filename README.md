Gesture-Controlled Virtual Mouse
A gesture-controlled virtual mouse system built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe that lets you control your computer’s cursor using hand gestures captured through a webcam — no physical mouse required!

Description
This project leverages real-time hand tracking to interpret finger and hand movements as mouse commands. Using MediaPipe’s hand landmark detection and OpenCV’s video processing capabilities, the system detects gestures such as pointing, clicking, and scrolling, allowing users to seamlessly interact with their computer cursor using just their hands.

Features
Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition

Move cursor by tracking index finger position

Click actions detected via specific finger gestures

Smooth and responsive cursor control

Eliminates the need for physical peripherals, ideal for touchless interaction
